# NOTICE - REACT UI UNDER CONSTRUCTION

A sign of completion of the project (which contains the latest Flask algorithm which replaces the old version and the React frontend) will be given, namely by submitting the project file in the form of a zip/rar archive in Google Classroom.
Recent changes to this repository can be seen in the master branch.
Until then, all operations and implementations are in the [pcd11september](https://github.com/thisisjackii/pcd11september) repository using Django/HTML templates and out-of-date algorithms.
