# NOTICE - REACT UI UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Due to less-than-foreseen time crunch, the Flask frontend is still under construction. However, recent changes to this repository can still be seen in the 'master' branch. A sign of completion of the project (which contains the latest Flask algorithm which replaces the old version and the React frontend) will be given, namely by submitting the project file in the form of a zip/rar archive in Google Classroom. Until then, all operations and implementations are in the [pcd11september](https://github.com/thisisjackii/pcd11september) repository (main branch) using Django/HTML templates and out-of-date algorithms.
